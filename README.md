# Predicting-Employee-Retention-with-HR-Analytics
The capstone project for my master's in data analytics degree.
>Combining 2 fake datasets from fake companies, the datasets will be combined, cleaned, explored, and trained by 4 classfication models to predict employee turnover and offer solutions for corrective steps in order to reduce turnover and increase employee development.

## Background

Employe turnover is the percentage of employees who leave an organization and are replaced by new employees. Employees can leave for a wide rane of reasons whether it be involuntary -- budget cuts or due to the restructuring of the organization -- or voluntary -- the employee found a better opportunity or is relocating. It's important for companies to track turnover because it can have significant negative impacts on a company. In 2021 the Work Institute's Report estimated that the cost of turnover for the average U.S. employee is aroung $15,000. Besides it being extremely costly for a company, it can affect the overall goals of the company, leads to lower morale, and results in the loss of fresh ideas, customer relationships, and expertise in specific areas.

## The Project

While employee turnover is an issue that many companies have, it is one that is hard to tackle.
This project will take 2 datasets and combine them and use machine learning mdoels to predict which employees will be most likely to leave given various attributes. Based on the predictions, a strategy will be defined to reduce employee turnover.
